                <br>
                Have you ever noticed that if you slice an apple in the morning, it turns brown by lunch? This is actually a chemical reaction at work! This is called <b>enzymatic browning</b>. Apple browning is a common phenomenon that occurs when the flesh of an apple is exposed to air. It is caused by a reaction between oxygen and certain enzymes in the apple, primarily <b>polyphenol oxidase (PPO)</b>. When an apple is cut or bruised, the cell walls break, allowing oxygen to react with the PPO enzyme, leading to the production of brown-coloured compounds called <b>melanin</b>.
                <br><br>
                Enzymes are substances produced by all living organisms that speed up chemical reactions. In this apple oxidation experiment, we are going to explore the factors that affect apple browning and investigate how different treatments such as <b>sugar, saltwater,</b> or <b>vinegar,</b> can reduce the brownish colour on apples once exposed with air. Understanding this process is important in food science, as it helps improve food preservation techniques and reduce waste.

                <br>Overall, the experiment confirms that enzymatic browning is influenced by oxygen availability, pH levels, and temperature. These findings are useful for food preservation techniques, helping to keep fruits fresh for longer periods.
