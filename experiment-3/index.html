                Have you ever wondered how detectives can solve crimes?<br>One of the most important tools they use is fingerprinting.
                <br><br>
                Just like snowflakes, no two people have the same fingerprints. These unique patterns on our fingerprints can be left behind at crime scenes. providing crucial evidence.<br>
                In this activity, we'll be exploring the world of forensic fingerprinting. We'll learn how to:<br><br>
                1. <b>Collect fingerprints:</b> We'll use different methods to collect out own fingerprints.<br>
                2. <b>Analyse fingerprints:</b> We'll examine our fingerprints closely and learn to identify different types of patterns.<br>
                3. <b>Compare fingerprints:</b> We'll compare our fingerprints to each other and see how they differ.<br><br>
                By the end of this activity, you'll have a better understanding of how forensic scientists use fingerprints to solve crimes. You might even become a future crime-solving expert!<br><br>
                Are you ready to become a forensic scientist for a day? Let's get started!

                <br>In this activity, we explored the unique world of fingerprints. We learned that fingerprints are unique to each individual and can be used to identify people.
                We collected our own fingerprints and we can analyse them to identify different types of patterns like loops, whorls, and arches. By comparing our fingerprints, we
                observed the incredible diversity and individuality of these unique patterns. This activity has demonstrated the importance of fingerprinting in forensic science and
                how it can be used to solve crimes. We now have a better understanding of how detectives and forensic scientists utilise this valuable tool.
